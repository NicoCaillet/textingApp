# Texting App #

### Objective ###
The objective of this proyect was challenging me to make a full front-end texting app. 

### UI - UX design ### 
For the UI - UX design, I chose to work with glassmorphism.
Why? I think that the visuals of the application are really important for an user to consume the service. 
So making an attractive UI-UX will attract more users! :)
